# Starting a Project Keynotes

General outlines of the project:

1. **Define the problem**: Clearly define the problem to solve with Machine Learning. Identify the business objectives
   and what you hope to achieve.
2. **Project Planning**: Define the scope of the project, set goals and objectives, determine timelines, and identify
   resources required to complete the project.
3. **Risk Management**: Identify and manage potential risks and challenges that may arise during the project. This
   involves creating contingency plans and monitoring risks throughout the project.
4. **Team Management**: Assemble and manage a team of experts with the necessary skills to complete the project. This
   may involve identifying team roles and responsibilities, setting up communication channels, and ensuring that team
   members are working effectively.
5. **Project Tracking**: Monitor progress against timelines and milestones, track project expenses, and manage the
   project budget. This involves keeping stakeholders informed of project status, identifying and addressing any issues
   that arise, and adjusting project plans as necessary.
6. **Documentation and Reporting**: Document project plans, data sources, models, and results. Communicate the project's
   status, progress, and results to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner.
7. **Model Maintenance and Improvement**: Continuously monitor the performance of the deployed models in production,
   retrain the models with new data, and improve the models as needed to maintain accuracy and reliability.

By applying project management principles and techniques to Machine Learning projects, organizations can ensure that
their Machine Learning projects are completed successfully, and that the models deployed into production meet the
desired performance and quality standards.

Another aspect to considering depending on the business need, team's need and solution is the tech stack:\
