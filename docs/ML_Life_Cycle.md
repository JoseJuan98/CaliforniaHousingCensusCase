# ML Life Cycle

The Machine Learning Life Cycle is a series of steps that a Machine Learning Engineer follows to develop and deploy machine learning models. The typical steps are:

1.  **Data Collection**: Collect data from various sources and ensure it's in a usable format.   
2.  **Data Preparation**: Clean, preprocess, and transform the data for machine learning.
3.  **Data Exploration**: Explore the data to gain insights and identify patterns.
4.  **Model Development**: Train models on the prepared data using various machine learning algorithms.
5.  **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using various metrics.
6.  **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model into a production environment and create an API that can be accessed by other applications.
7.  **Model Monitoring and Maintenance**: Monitor the model's performance and retrain it with new data periodically to improve its performance.

These steps are iterative and require continuous improvement and refinement. As a Machine Learning Engineer, maybe it's needed go back and forth between them until the desired results are achieved.
