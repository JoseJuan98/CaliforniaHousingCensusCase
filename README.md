## Aim

The aim of this project to showcase a high quality work ready to highlight my analytical, technical and communicative skills needed for producing a successful and resilient Machine Learning system, from the exploratory and
modelling phase focus in the exploration, statistical analysis and good practices of Machine Learning, to the engineering phase to containerize all dependencies of the system and put it into production exposing this work in
a resilient manner, meanwhile giving concise and informative insights in a business-manner for no technical stakeholders.

To differentiate between phases and follow good practices I am following the gitflow methodology.

## Dataset

This California Housing dataset is available from [Lu√≠s Torgo's page](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html) (University of Porto).

This dataset appeared in a 1997 paper titled Sparse Spatial Autoregressions by Pace, R. Kelley and Ronald Barry, published in the Statistics and Probability Letters journal. They built it using the 1990 
California census data. It contains one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a 
population of 600 to 3,000 people).

The target variable or dependent variable for this analysis will be the `median_house_value`, which describes median price of the houses per block group.

## Check list

This check-list shows the phases of the project has been already done and the next steps:

- [X] Exploratory Data Analysis
- [] Regression Analysis/Machine Learning Modelling
- [] API development to expose the final model
- [] Containerization of the API to be able to deploy it in any environment
